# Satellite Visualization Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a beautiful, browser-based 3D satellite visualization platform that makes space accessible and engaging for everyone
- Establish the first educational satellite visualization platform that combines artistic beauty with technical accuracy
- Reach 10,000 active users within 12 months of launch, with 500+ educators using the platform for lessons within 6 months
- Achieve $50K ARR through premium features within 18 months
- Become the leading educational satellite visualization platform in the market
- Inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers through beautiful space visualization

### Background Context

The satellite visualization market is dominated by technical tools that lack artistic appeal and user engagement. Most people have little awareness of the sheer number of satellites in orbit, their functions, and their implications. Current tools like CesiumJS and Google Earth are either too technical for general audiences or lack the visual appeal and storytelling elements needed to engage and educate.

Our research reveals a significant untapped opportunity: a **$2.3B Total Addressable Market (TAM)** with a **$180M Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)** for educational space visualization tools. The market timing is perfect with 400% increase in satellite launches (2010-2024), 89% of educators now using digital tools, and 78% of people more interested in space than 5 years ago.

The platform will combine artistic beauty with technical accuracy to create an interactive, educational experience that helps users understand satellites, their orbits, and their impact on our world. Our target market includes educators, students, space enthusiasts, and the general public who want to explore space in a beautiful, accessible way.
