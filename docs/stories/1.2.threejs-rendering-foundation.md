# Story 1.2: Three.js 3D Rendering Foundation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic Three.js scene with camera controls and rendering pipeline,
**so that** I can build the 3D satellite visualization on a solid foundation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Three.js Integration**: Three.js is properly integrated with React using React Three Fiber
2. **Scene Setup**: Basic 3D scene is created with camera, lighting, and renderer
3. **Camera Controls**: OrbitControls are implemented for smooth camera movement
4. **Responsive Rendering**: Scene automatically resizes based on window dimensions
5. **Performance Monitoring**: FPS counter and performance metrics are displayed in development mode
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for devices without WebGL support
7. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of Three.js resources to prevent memory leaks
8. **Shader Support**: Custom shader system is established for future artistic effects
9. **Asset Loading**: Texture and model loading system is implemented
10. **Development Tools**: Three.js dev tools are integrated for debugging and optimization

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the existing setup from Story 1.1:

**Current Three.js Setup** [Source: packages/frontend/src/components/SatelliteVisualization.tsx]:
- React Three Fiber Canvas with basic configuration
- OrbitControls from @react-three/drei
- Basic lighting (ambient + directional)
- Simple Earth and satellite components

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Three.js**: WebGL-based 3D rendering engine
- **React Three Fiber**: React renderer for Three.js
- **Drei**: Useful helpers for React Three Fiber
- **Custom Shaders**: GLSL shaders for artistic effects

**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **60fps** target on mid-range devices
- **3 seconds** initial load time
- **100MB** maximum memory usage
- **WebGL 2.0** preferred, **WebGL 1.0** fallback

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **Resource Management**: Always dispose of Three.js resources
- **Use useFrame**: For animations, use useFrame hook
- **Optimize Geometries**: Reuse geometries and materials when possible
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### File Locations
Based on the project structure:
- **3D Components**: packages/frontend/src/components/
- **Shaders**: packages/frontend/src/shaders/
- **Assets**: packages/frontend/src/assets/
- **Utils**: packages/frontend/src/utils/
- **Types**: packages/frontend/src/types/

### Performance Considerations
- **Frame Rate**: Target 60fps, minimum 30fps
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor and limit to 100MB
- **Loading Time**: Optimize asset loading and caching
- **Device Compatibility**: Graceful degradation for older devices

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Test component rendering and cleanup
- **Performance Tests**: Monitor frame rate and memory usage
- **Integration Tests**: Test camera controls and interactions
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure 3D scene is accessible

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Based on architecture/testing-strategy.md:

**Test File Location**:
- Unit tests: packages/frontend/tests/
- Integration tests: packages/frontend/tests/integration/
- Performance tests: Custom 3D rendering benchmarks

**Testing Frameworks**:
- **Unit**: Jest + React Testing Library
