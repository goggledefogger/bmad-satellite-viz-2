## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
Based on the architecture documents created:

**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite, Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **Backend**: Node.js 18+ with TypeScript, Vercel Functions
- **Package Management**: pnpm for monorepo workspace management
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky for git hooks
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for E2E

**Project Structure** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- **Monorepo Structure**: Root with packages/ directory containing frontend, backend, shared, and ui packages
- **Package Organization**: Each package has src/, tests/, package.json, tsconfig.json
- **File Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- **Path Mapping**: @shared/*, @ui/*, @frontend/*, @backend/* for clean imports

**Coding Standards** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]:
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled, explicit types required, no any type
- **React**: Functional components with hooks, proper prop types, performance optimization
- **Three.js**: Resource management, useFrame for animations, proper cleanup
- **Testing**: 80%+ coverage target, Jest + React Testing Library, accessibility testing

**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest with 80%+ coverage target
- **Integration Tests**: Supertest for API testing, MSW for mocking
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for cross-browser testing
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse, custom 3D rendering performance tests
- **Accessibility Tests**: axe-core for WCAG AA compliance

### File Locations
Based on the project structure:
- **Root**: package.json, pnpm-workspace.yaml, tsconfig.json, .env.example
- **Frontend**: packages/frontend/ with React + Three.js setup
- **Backend**: packages/backend/ with Node.js + TypeScript
- **Shared**: packages/shared/ for common utilities and types
- **UI**: packages/ui/ for shared UI components
- **CI/CD**: .github/workflows/ for GitHub Actions

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with hot reloading
- **Staging**: Preview deployments via Vercel
- **Production**: Automated deployment to Vercel
- **Environment Variables**: API URLs, database connections, monitoring keys

### Testing Requirements
- **Test Location**: Co-located with source code in tests/ directories
- **Test Standards**: Jest configuration with TypeScript support
- **Coverage**: 80%+ coverage requirement for business logic
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting

## Testing

### Testing Standards
Based on architecture/testing-strategy.md:

**Test File Location**:
- Unit tests: Co-located with source code in tests/ directories
- Integration tests: packages/*/tests/integration/
- E2E tests: e2e/ directory at root level

**Testing Frameworks**:
